/* Links that become a card, as Notion embeds them (Winston, round 65): a
   YouTube video, played in YouTube's privacy-enhanced player, and a post on
   X, drawn by Notes — compact, its pictures small (round 66) — from what X
   gives out about it. A card is recognised from its address alone; its
   words, and where its pictures are, are read by the card service
   @notes/web-card-preview
   (round 67), which reads the providers — for
   whoever made the card, checked here, and stored beside the address. A
   post's pictures are then fetched by each reader through the platform,
   never from X's host by the page itself.

   How an address, a stored card or a provider's answer can be wrong — a
   card is written by another member's client, an older one or the agent,
   and its words by a page on the web:
    1. a host that only resembles YouTube's or X's (youtube.com.evil.test,
       notyoutube.com, a userinfo "x.com@evil.test") → no card;
    2. a scheme other than http(s) → no card;
    3. a video id that is not exactly eleven of [A-Za-z0-9_-] → no card, so
       nothing can ride into the player's or the picture's address;
    4. every shape of YouTube's is read — watch?v=, youtu.be/, shorts/,
       embed/, live/, the m. and music. hosts, youtube-nocookie.com — and a
       channel, a playlist without a video or the home page → no card;
    5. a start time — t=90, 90s, 1m30s, 1h2m3s, start= — becomes seconds;
       anything else, zero, or past a day is no start;
    6. X's shapes — x.com, twitter.com, their www. and mobile. hosts, a post
       with /photo/1 or ?s=20 after it — are one canonical address; a handle
       outside [A-Za-z0-9_]{1,15}, a reserved path (home, search, i…) or an
       id that is not 1–19 digits → no card;
    7. a stored card is what its stored address says: the provider, the ids
       and the canonical address are read from it again, never trusted; an
       address that is no card → no card;
    8. stored words (a title, a name, a post's text, a date) that are not
       strings are dropped; control and direction-override characters are
       taken out; each is held to its length, a post's text keeping its line
       breaks and nothing else;
    9. a brick's answer is data too: kept only as a stored card is kept
       (7, 8, 10–13 hold for it) — a video's card keeps its own address and
       start; a post's answer that names another post adds nothing; an
       answer saying the video or post is gone (`missing`) adds nothing but
       `read`; one that is neither found nor missing (`unavailable`, not an
       answer, no answer) keeps nothing, so the card is asked about again;
   10. X's stand-in for a post's pictures and videos — the
       "pic.twitter.com/…" (or "pic.x.com/…") it puts among the words — is
       not words: it is dropped from a stored card, and the words around it
       keep their spaces and lines;
   11. when a post was made is a time or nothing — read again as one exact
       instant, shown in the reader's own zone, never pinned to one;
   12. a picture is on X's picture host alone — https://pbs.twimg.com/, a
       post's media, a video's or GIF's still, or a profile picture, a plain
       path with an image's extension: another host, a query, a "..", a
       path of any other shape → no picture; at most four are kept, sizes
       are whole positive numbers or none, a kind is photo, video or gif;
   13. a post X marks as possibly sensitive keeps no pictures to show: it
       says it is sensitive (`sensitive`), and a stored card saying so
       shows none of the pictures it may still hold. */
