/* Notion's undo. Every change made in this window — a keystroke, a block moved,
   a page sent to the trash, a database view renamed — is taken back with ⌘Z
   and put back with ⌘⇧Z, and the caret goes back to where the change was made.

   History sits at the one place every edit passes through: the workspace's
   list of mutations. A step keeps, for each path it touched, the value that
   path held before and after; undo writes the befores back, redo the afters.
   Everything one press, click, paste or drop does is one step, and a run of
   typing in one place folds into one step, so ⌘Z takes back a phrase rather
   than a letter.

   Nobody else's work is ever undone. When another person — or this person
   in another window — has written a path since, the step is replayed on top
   of what they wrote rather than over it: in a block, field by field; in its
   words (or a page's name), as a change from the runs the step started
   from, which is merged with theirs character by character, so taking
   back your words leaves theirs beside them; in the two id lists (the
   top-level pages and a database's rows), only this step's own insertions
   and removals. Where both touched the same field, theirs stands.

   History is the document, not the chrome: the person's preferences, page
   history checkpoints, favourites, sharing and the updated stamp are never
   steps. */
