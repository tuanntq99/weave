   session however often its page is opened, never let go of under a view
   that shows it, and let go of oldest first once nothing shows it and the
   session holds more than 96 MiB — and the uploader's browser, which holds a
   photo anyway, makes the smaller copy the page draws (shared/thumbnail.ts).
   What is being uploaded exists only in this window until it is written: it
